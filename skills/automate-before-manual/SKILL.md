# Automate before manual

Before asking the user to click, install, create a token, configure DNS, or run something in their terminal:

## 1. Try automation first

- GitHub: `gh` CLI or PAT from the secrets vault (see below)
- Deploy: scripts in `docs/deploy-vps.md`, `scripts/deploy-*`, GitHub Actions API
- SSH: deploy keys documented in the project or secrets vault
- Azure: `az login` or service principal path documented in the repo

## 2. Secrets vault (relative paths only)

**Never hardcode absolute paths** (`C:\...`, `/home/...`) in skills, commits, or chat copy.

From the **project repo root**, the shared vault is:

```
../secrets/
```

Common files (read only if they exist):

| Need | Relative path |
|------|----------------|
| GitHub PAT | `../secrets/github/pat.txt` (line starting with `ghp_`) |
| VPS SSH | `../secrets/vps/ssh/` |
| Per-app env | `../secrets/projects/<app>.env` |
| VPS inventory | `../secrets/vps/inventory.md` |

If the repo layout differs, check `AGENTS.md` or `secrets.local.md` in the project for the vault location — still prefer **relative** paths in docs.

## 3. Before asking for a credential

State which **role/scope** unlocks full automation (e.g. GitHub repo scope, Azure Contributor). Only escalate when impossible: OAuth consent, 2FA, billing, domain registrar.

## 4. Do not

- Send a manual checklist without trying API/SSH/PAT/Azure first
- Ask permission for steps you can already run with existing keys
- Commit or paste secrets into the repo or skills.sh
